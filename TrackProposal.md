## Course 1. Machine Learning for Beginners

###### Marketing Proposal

What is machine learning? This non technical course will answer all of those basic machine learning questions that you don't want to ask, because you don't have to be a coding expert to understand machine learning! 

###### Learning Objectives

* Learner wil be able to define machine learning, limits and dangers, and its relation to data science and artificial intelligence
* Learner will be able to explain the difference between the terms 'unsupervised' and 'supervised' learning


## Course 2. Introduction to Python 

###### Marketing Proposal

Welcome to Introduction to Python. In this course, you will learn the basics of Python, one of the world's most popular and powerful general-purpose programming languages and how it can be applied to data science. You will start by learning the very basics, from here, you'll build your knowledge incrementally until you're ready to start using functions and packages to improve efficiency in your code. You'll be able to test your progress step by step, having a go at challenges and receiving instant feedback and support. 

###### Learning Objectives

* Learner will demonstrate and apply basic syntax and create variables
* Learner will effectively store, access, and manipulate data in lists
* Learner will create and apply functions, methods, and packages to improve efficiency 

## Course 3. Intermediate Python 

###### Marketing Proposal

Upgrade your Python skills with Intermediate Python. Learning Python is essential for any aspiring data science practitioner. In this course you will learn all about the exciting world of data visualization and data structures, helping you to make more sense of your data. Then, you'll get to practice applying boolean logic, control flow, and loops in Python.

###### Learning Objectives

* Learner will be able to build and customise plots in Matplotlib
* Learner will be able to effectively create and manipulate datasets
* Learner will be able to apply Boolean outcomes in control structure.

## Course 4. Python in Data Science 

###### Marketing Proposal

Now you know Python, lets apply it to data science! This course will teach you how to write your own functions, complete with multiple parameters and multiple return values, along with default arguments and variable-length arguments. 

###### Learning Objectives

* Learner will be able to apply Functions with default arguments
* Learner will be able to effectively use iterators and iterables

## Course 5. Statistical Thinking in Python

###### Marketing Proposal

The power of statistics has been utilised for hundreds of years. However, computers have revolutionised statistical thinking, allowing us to process huge data sets in a near instant. In the era of big data, data science and machine learning have become essential in many fields of science and technology. A fundamental aspect of working with any data is the ability to describe, summarize, and represent data visually. In this course we will learn all about Python statistics libraries, a key tool that will assist you in working with data.

## Course 6. Supervised & Unsupervised learning in Python

###### Marketing Proposal

Supervised: Machine learning is the field that teaches machines and computers to learn from existing data to make predictions on new data: Will a tumor be benign or malignant? Which of your customers will take their business elsewhere? Is a particular email spam? In this course, you'll learn how to use Python to perform supervised learning, an essential component of machine learning. You'll learn how to build predictive models, tune their parameters, and determine how well they will perform with unseen dataâ€”all while using real world datasets. You'll be using scikit-learn, one of the most popular and user-friendly machine learning libraries for Python.

Unsupervised: Say you have a collection of customers with a variety of characteristics such as age, location, and financial history, and you wish to discover patterns and sort them into clusters. Or perhaps you have a set of texts, such as wikipedia pages, and you wish to segment them into categories based on their content. This is the world of unsupervised learning, called as such because you are not guiding, or supervising, the pattern discovery by some prediction task, but instead uncovering hidden structure from unlabeled data. Unsupervised learning encompasses a variety of techniques in machine learning, from clustering to dimension reduction to matrix factorization. In this course, you'll learn the fundamentals of unsupervised learning and implement the essential algorithms using scikit-learn and scipy. You will learn how to cluster, transform, visualize, and extract insights from unlabeled datasets, and end the course by building a recommender system to recommend popular musical artists




###### Learning Objectives

* Learner will end course with an assessment on Machine Learning in Python
