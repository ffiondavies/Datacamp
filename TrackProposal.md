## Course 1. Machine Learning for Beginners

###### Marketing Proposal

What is machine learning? This non technical course will answer all of those basic machine learning questions that you don't want to ask, because you don't have to be a coding expert to understand machine learning! 

###### Learning Objectives

* Learner wil be able to define machine learning, limits and dangers, and its relation to data science and artificial intelligence
* Learner will be able to explain the difference between the terms 'unsupervised' and 'supervised' learning


## Course 2. Introduction to Python 

###### Marketing Proposal

Welcome to Introduction to Python. In this course, you will learn the basics of Python, one of the world's most popular and powerful general-purpose programming languages and how it can be applied to data science. You will start by learning the very basics, from here, you'll build your knowledge incrementally until you're ready to start using functions and packages to improve efficiency in your code. You'll be able to test your progress step by step, having a go at challenges and receiving instant feedback and support. 

###### Learning Objectives

* Learner will demonstrate and apply basic syntax and create variables
* Learner will effectively store, access, and manipulate data in lists
* Learner will create and apply functions, methods, and packages to improve efficiency 

## Course 3. Intermediate Python 

###### Marketing Proposal

Upgrade your Python skills with Intermediate Python. Learning Python is essential for any aspiring data science practitioner. In this course you will learn all about the exciting world of data visualization and data structures, helping you to make more sense of your data. Then, you'll get to practice applying boolean logic, control flow, and loops in Python.

###### Learning Objectives

* Learner will be able to build and customise plots in Matplotlib
* Learner will be able to effectively create and manipulate datasets
* Learner will be able to apply Boolean outcomes in control structure.

## Course 4. Python in Data Science 

###### Marketing Proposal

Now you know Python, lets apply it to data science! This course will teach you how to write your own functions, complete with multiple parameters and multiple return values, along with default arguments and variable-length arguments. 

###### Learning Objectives

* Learner will be able to apply Functions with default arguments
* Learner will be able to effectively use iterators and iterables

## Course 5. Statistical Thinking in Python

###### Marketing Proposal

The power of statistics has been utilised for hundreds of years. However, computers have revolutionised statistical thinking, allowing us to process huge data sets in a near instant. In the era of big data, data science and machine learning have become essential in many fields of science and technology. A fundamental aspect of working with any data is the ability to describe, summarize, and represent data visually. In this course we will learn all about using Pythons role in statistitical  analysis. 


###### Learning Objectives

* Learner will be able to  plot, interpret and adjust a histogram
* Learner will be able to compute useful summary statistics including means, medians, variance, standard deviation, correlation coefficient and covariance
* Learner will be able to think probabalistically and apply this knowledge to challenges using Python

## Course 6. Supervised Learning

###### Marketing Proposal


Machine learning is all about extracting knowledge from existing data and making predicitions on new data. The application of machine learning methods has become present in everyday life. From recommendations of which films to watch, to which products to buy, to recognising your friends on social media. In this course, you will learn how to use scikit-learn in Python, to perform supervised learning on the Iris Species dataset - a typical test case for many statistical classification techniques and also known as the ‘Hello World’ of machine learning – so, a great place to start! You will use supervised learning models to predict the correct label for newly presented input data in the dataset, evaluate your models performance and fine-tune this to improve effectiveness. 

###### Learning Objectives

* Learner will be able to implement the key concepts of supervised learning on the Iris dataset
* Learner will be able to apply a Regression Model to the Iris dataset and classify species of the Iris
* Learner will be able to explore results by changing model parameters to evaluate and improve model performance


## Course 7. Unsupervised Learning

In this course, we will continue to use the Iris dataset, we’ll use this along with other real-life datasets to make predictions. As you will know from ‘Supervised Machine Learning’ The dataset contains 150 records under four attributes and three iris classes. We’ll feed the four features of our flower to the unsupervised algorithm and it will predict which class the iris belongs to. We’ll use the scikit-learn library in Python to load the Iris dataset and matplotlib for data visualization. Then, we’ll apply this learning to a range of real life datasets. 

* Learner can use K-means clustering in Python to predict flower species
* Learner can apply clustering to a range of different data sets
* Learner will be able to apply Principal Component Analysis to the dataset
