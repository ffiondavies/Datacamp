## Course 1. Machine Learning for Beginners

###### Marketing Proposal

What is machine learning? This non technical course will answer all of those basic machine learning questions that you don't want to ask, because you don't have to be a coding expert to understand machine learning! 

###### Learning Objectives

* Learner wil be able to define machine learning and its relation to data science and artificial intelligence
* Learner will be able to understand and explain the different types of machine learning as well as the limits and dangers of machine learning
* Learner will be able to explain the difference between the terms 'unsupervised' and 'supervised' learning
* Leaner will construct a model and evaluate and improve this model

## Course 2. Introduction to Python (contain skill assessment here)

###### Marketing Proposal

Welcome to Introduction to Python. In this course, you will learn the basics of Python, one of the world's most popular and powerful general-purpose programming languages and how it can be applied to data science. 

###### Learning Objectives

* Learner will understand and apply basic syntax and create variables
* Learner will effectively store, access, and manipulate data in lists
* Learner wil use functions, methods, and packages efficiently 
* Learner will be able to work with tools in the NumPy array

## Course 3. Intermediate Python 

###### Marketing Proposal

Upgrade your python skills with Intermediate Python. Learning Python is essential for any aspiring data science practitioner. In this course you will learn all about the exciting world of data visualization and data structures. Then, you'll get thrown into boolean logic, control flow, and loops in Python.

###### Learning Objectives
