Course: Introduction to Python
================================

Chapter 1: Writing Structured Programs & Using Variables
-------------------------------------------------------

**Lesson 1.**
**Objective:** 
Learner will be able to demonstrate creating a function in Python 
**Description:** 
* Comments are identified with the hash `#` symbol. 
* Subroutines `def`
* Subroutines that do not return any values are called `procedures`. 
* Subroutines that return values are called `functions`. 
* Keywords E.g. `print`. 

**Lesson 2.**
**Objective:** 
Learner will be able to demonstrate using variables, creating constants, and concatenation with various datatypes.
**Description:**
* Functions, Parameters, Variables, Constants, Concatenation. 
* Storing user input.
* Datatypes
* Integers & decimals, Casting Random, Output formatting, Mod, Div , string manipulation functions.
* Defining an identifier. 
* Assigning variables  
* Initialising the variable.


**Lesson 3.**
**Objective:** 
Learner will demonstrate using controlled iterations
**Description:**
* `while` `do`
* `Counter-controlled` iterations
* Positive and negative steps.
* Nesting



Chapter 2: Arrays & Lists
-----------------------------------

**Lesson 1.**
**Objective:** 
Learner will be able to demonstrate interpreting arrays and lists effectively and describe the difference between and array and a list.
**Description:**
* E.g. Variables can only contain one value. Sometimes it would be useful if a single identifier could hold multiple items. E.g. names of students in a class, or in this example, words in a sentence. A list is an alternative to a variable that does this.
* Data types
* Elements
* Indexing
* Dynamic data structure
* Pointers

**Lesson 2.**
**Objective:** 
Learner will be able to create and output the contents of a list 
**Description:**
* e.g. Function to output the contents of a list called sentence `def OutputList(Sentence):`
* Learner will apply knowledge of elements & indexing
* Change elements by referring to their index.
* Use iteration to loop through the elements

**Lesson 4.**
**Objective:** 
Learner will be able to demonstrate manipulating an array & list
**Description:**
* Change, add and remove list items: `append()` `insert()` `extend()` `remove()` `del()` `pop()` `clear()`. Join lists using `+` and `extend()`

**Lesson 3.**
**Objective:** 
Learner will be able to demonstrate knowledge of, and apply global data structure and local data structure 
**Description:**
* Global data structures are available to all subroutines. 
* Local data structures are only available to the subroutine they are declared in. 





Chapter 3: Importing Modules and Functions
------------------------------------------------




Chapter 4: NumPy
----------------------------------------------

| Lesson | Objective | Description |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
|  1 | Learner will be able to compare numpy to lists, install and import numpy, describe numpy and why we use it | What is numpy used for, why? What does it stand for. How numpy compares to lists. Why we use numpy in datascience |
| 2 | Learner will be able to demonstrate using `np.array()` to create a numpy array, sort this and output values from the array | Introduction to `np.array()` concept, assigning results of function to array, printing out results of the variable, apply `np.sort()` |
| 3 | Learner will be able to create and output values from a 2D array | Introduction to 2D arrays in Python, `ndarray` class in NumPy. Create a basic array using `np.array()` |
| 4 | Learner will be able to illustrate taking a section of specific array elements to use in further analysis by subsetting and slicing | Introduce learner to selecting a range of values from an array using subsets, slice elements from two-dimensional arrays `[row_index, column_index]`. Slice multiple elements using: `[start_row_index:end_row_index, start_column_index:end_column_index]`
