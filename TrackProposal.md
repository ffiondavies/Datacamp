## Course 1. Machine Learning for Beginners

###### Marketing Proposal

What is machine learning? This non technical course will answer all of those basic machine learning questions that you don't want to ask, because you don't have to be a coding expert to understand machine learning! 

###### Learning Objectives

* Learner wil be able to define machine learning and its relation to data science and artificial intelligence
* Learner will be able to understand and explain the different types of machine learning as well as the limits and dangers of machine learning
* Learner will be able to explain the difference between the terms 'unsupervised' and 'supervised' learning
* Leaner will construct a model and evaluate and improve this model

## Course 2. Introduction to Python (contain skill assessment here)

###### Marketing Proposal

Welcome to Introduction to Python. In this course, you will learn the basics of Python, one of the world's most popular and powerful general-purpose programming languages and how it can be applied to data science. You will take part in a skills assessment to test your knowledge!

###### Learning Objectives

* Learner will understand and apply basic syntax and create variables
* Learner will effectively store, access, and manipulate data in lists
* Learner wil use functions, methods, and packages efficiently 
* Learner will be able to work with tools in the NumPy array

## Course 3. Intermediate Python 

###### Marketing Proposal

Upgrade your python skills with Intermediate Python. Learning Python is essential for any aspiring data science practitioner. In this course you will learn all about the exciting world of data visualization and data structures. Then, you'll get thrown into boolean logic, control flow, and loops in Python.

###### Learning Objectives

* Learner be able to build and customise plots in Matplotlib
* Learner will effectively create and manipulate datasets
* Learner will be confident solving boolean logic problems and will know how to use the Boolean outcomes in control structure.
* Learner will apply loops in Python

## Course 4. Python in Data Science 

###### Marketing Proposal

Now you know Python, lets apply it to data science! This course will teach you how to write your own functions, complete with multiple parameters and multiple return values, along with default arguments and variable-length arguments. 

###### Learning Objectives

* Learner will be able to understand and apply Functions with default arguments
* Learner will effectively use iterators and iterables

## Course 5. Statistical Thinking in Python

###### Marketing Proposal

After all of the hard work of acquiring data and getting them into a form you can work with, you ultimately want to make clear, succinct conclusions from them. This crucial last step of a data analysis pipeline hinges on the principles of statistical inference. In this course, you will start building the foundation you need to think statistically, speak the language of your data, and understand what your data is telling you. The foundations of statistical thinking took decades to build, but can be grasped much faster today with the help of computers. With the power of Python-based tools, you will rapidly get up-to-speed and begin thinking statistically by the end of this course.

## Course 6. Supervised & Unsupervised learning in Python

###### Marketing Proposal

Supervised: Machine learning is the field that teaches machines and computers to learn from existing data to make predictions on new data: Will a tumor be benign or malignant? Which of your customers will take their business elsewhere? Is a particular email spam? In this course, you'll learn how to use Python to perform supervised learning, an essential component of machine learning. You'll learn how to build predictive models, tune their parameters, and determine how well they will perform with unseen dataâ€”all while using real world datasets. You'll be using scikit-learn, one of the most popular and user-friendly machine learning libraries for Python.

Unsupervised: Say you have a collection of customers with a variety of characteristics such as age, location, and financial history, and you wish to discover patterns and sort them into clusters. Or perhaps you have a set of texts, such as wikipedia pages, and you wish to segment them into categories based on their content. This is the world of unsupervised learning, called as such because you are not guiding, or supervising, the pattern discovery by some prediction task, but instead uncovering hidden structure from unlabeled data. Unsupervised learning encompasses a variety of techniques in machine learning, from clustering to dimension reduction to matrix factorization. In this course, you'll learn the fundamentals of unsupervised learning and implement the essential algorithms using scikit-learn and scipy. You will learn how to cluster, transform, visualize, and extract insights from unlabeled datasets, and end the course by building a recommender system to recommend popular musical artists




###### Learning Objectives

* Learner will end course with an assessment on Machine Learning in Python
