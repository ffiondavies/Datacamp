Course: Introduction to Python
================================

Chapter 1: Writing Structured Programs & Using Variables
-------------------------------------------------------

| Lesson | Objective | Description |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
|  1 | Learner will be able to demonstrate creating a function in Python | Programs should start with a comment stating the purpose of the program.
Comments are identified with the hash # symbol. Programs should be structured into sections of code called subroutines. Subroutines are identified with the def keyword. Each subroutine should start with a comment to explain what it does. Subroutines that do not return any values are called procedures. Subroutines that return values are called functions. Keywords are the words that the programming language uses for instructions. E.g. print. Keywords are also called reserved words because you cannot use them for other purposes in your program. e.g. you cannot call a subroutine print. Python is case sensitive. This means that keywords must be entered in the correct case. |
| 2 | Learner will be able to demonstrate using variables, creating constants, and concatenation |  Text in a program is called a string. It is a string of characters. Strings are qualified with double quote marks. E.g. “This is a string” to show where the text starts and ends. Constants are values in a program that can only be changed by the programmer. The program does not change them when it is running. Variables are places in memory where values are stored. They are given an identifier to name them. |
| 3 | Learner will be able to create and use different assignment operators and data types | `int`  ` float`  `str`  `bool`, `=` `*=` `/=` . Variables have a data type that describes the data they are storing, e.g. string, float etc. This reserves the correct amount of memory for the data. Specifying the data type is not necessary in Python. The name of a variable is called an identifier. Different variables can have the same identifier in different subroutines.When variables are given a value they are said to be assigned. Giving a variable an initial value is called initialising the variable.|


Chapter 2: Lists
-----------------------------------

| Lesson | Objective | Description |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
|  1 | Learner will be able to create and interpret a list | Create and output lists of different data types  |
| 2 | Learner will be able to demonstrate accessing data in lists | Introduction to indexing, negative indexing, range of indexing and checking if data exists `in` a list. `slice()` function to slice a sequence |
| 3 | Learner will be able to demonstrate sorting data from lists using a range of sorting methods | `sort()` lists alphabetically, numerically, descending, case insensitive, reverse order |
| 4 | Learner will be able to illustrate manipulating data in lists | Change, add and remove list items: `append()` `insert()` `extend()` `remove()` `del()` `clear()`. Join lists using `+` and `extend()`


Chapter 3: Improving efficiency 
------------------------------------------------

| Lesson | Objective | Description |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
|  1 | Learner will be able to create functions and receive arguments | Create a function using `def`, pass variables, and `return` variables |
| 2 | Learner will be able to demonstrate importing existing functions to improve efficiency of code | Call and apply existing functions in a block of code |
| 3 | Learner will be able to demonstrate writing and importing existing modules to improve efficiency of code | Introduction to writing modules `.py` and importing modules, introduction to built-in modules |
| 4 | Learner will be able to demonstrate organising modules into packages and sub packages and importing existing packages | What is a package and why we use them, how to create a package to store modules, how to control package initialization, existing packages



Chapter 4: NumPy
----------------------------------------------

| Lesson | Objective | Description |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
|  1 | Learner will be able to compare numpy to lists, install and import numpy, describe numpy and why we use it | What is numpy used for, why? What does it stand for. How numpy compares to lists. Why we use numpy in datascience |
| 2 | Learner will be able to demonstrate using `np.array()` to create a numpy array, sort this and output values from the array | Introduction to `np.array()` concept, assigning results of function to array, printing out results of the variable, apply `np.sort()` |
| 3 | Learner will be able to create and output values from a 2D array | Introduction to 2D arrays in Python, `ndarray` class in NumPy. Create a basic array using `np.array()` |
| 4 | Learner will be able to illustrate taking a section of specific array elements to use in further analysis by subsetting and slicing | Introduce learner to selecting a range of values from an array using subsets, slice elements from two-dimensional arrays `[row_index, column_index]`. Slice multiple elements using: `[start_row_index:end_row_index, start_column_index:end_column_index]`
