Course: Introduction to Python
================================

Chapter 1: Writing Structured Programs & Using Variables
-------------------------------------------------------

**Lesson 1.**

Objective: 
Learner will be able to demonstrate creating a function in Python 

Description:

* Comments are identified with the hash `#` symbol
* Subroutines `def`
* Subroutines that do not return any values are called `procedures`
* Subroutines that return values are called `functions` 
* Keywords E.g. `print` 

**Lesson 2.**

Objective:
Learner will be able to demonstrate using variables, creating constants, and concatenation with various datatypes

Description:

* Functions, parameters, variables, constants, concatenation 
* Storing user input
* Datatypes 
* Integers & decimals, casting random, output formatting, mod, div , string manipulation functions
* Defining an identifier 
* Calculator
* Assigning variables  
* Initialising the variable


**Lesson 3.**

Objective: 
Learner will demonstrate using controlled iterations

Description:

* `while` `do`
* `Counter-controlled` iterations
* Positive and negative steps
* Nesting



Chapter 2: Arrays & Lists
-----------------------------------

**Lesson 1.**

Objective:
Learner will be able to demonstrate interpreting arrays and lists effectively and describe the difference between and array and a list

Description:

* E.g. Variables can only contain one value. Sometimes it would be useful if a single identifier could hold multiple items. E.g. names of students in a class, or in this example, words in a sentence. A list is an alternative to a variable that does this
* Data types
* Elements
* Indexing
* Dynamic data structure
* Pointers

**Lesson 2.**

Objective:
Learner will be able to create and output the contents of a list 

Description:

* e.g. Function to output the contents of a list called sentence `def OutputList(Sentence):`
* Learner will apply knowledge of elements & indexing
* Change elements by referring to their index
* Use iteration to loop through the elements

**Lesson 4.**

Objective:
Learner will be able to demonstrate manipulating an array & list

Description:

* Change, add and remove list items: `append()` `insert()` `extend()` `remove()` `del()` `pop()` `clear()`. Join lists using `+` and `extend()`

**Lesson 3.**

Objective:
Learner will be able to demonstrate knowledge of, and apply global data structure and local data structure 

Description:

* Global data structures 
* Local data structures 





Chapter 3: Python Modules
------------------------------------------------

**Lesson 1.**

Objective:
Learner will be able to demonstrate creating and using a module

Description:

* What is a module
* `.py`
* `import`
* Creating variables and functions in a module

**Lesson 2**

Objective:
Learner will be able to demonstrate using Python math module

Description

* `min()` and `max()`
* `abs()`
* `math.sqrt()`

**Lesson 3**

Objective:
Learner will be able to demonstrate downloading and installing packages using PIP

Description:

* What is a package
* Install a package
* `list()` packages


**Lesson 4**

Objective:
Learner will be able to demonstrate importing modules and describe their use 

Description:

* Matplotlib
* Pandas
* Numpy




Chapter 4: NumPy
----------------------------------------------

**Lesson 1.**

Objective:
Learner will be able to compare numpy to lists, install and import numpy, describe numpy and why we use it

Description:

* Why use numpy ?
* Why is numpy faster than lists?
* Import `numpy` as `np`

**Lesson 2.**

Objective:
Learner will be able to demonstrate creating an array, and access elements from this array. 

Description:

* `np.array()` 
* Assigning results of function to array
* Printing out results of the variable
* Apply `np.sort()`
* Data types in numpy 

**Lesson 3.**

Objective:
Learner will be able to demonstrate numpy array slicing

Description:
* `[start:end]`
* `[start:end:step]`
* Negative

**Lesson 4.**

Objective:
Learner will be able to demonstrate joinig, splitting and searching arrays

Description:

* `concatenate()`
* `stack ()`
* `array_split()`
* `where()`
