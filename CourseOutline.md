Course: Introduction to Python
================================

Chapter 1: Syntax
-------------------------------------------------------

Lesson 1.1: Introduction
* Learner will be able to use basic Python syntax to output a message and describe why we use Python
* Introduction to what Python is, Python interface, outputing a message `print` & commenting `#`. 

Lesson 1.2: Calulator
* Learner will be able to use Python to calculate simple math problems
* Using Python as a calulator: `+` `-` `*`  `/`  `%`  `**` 

Lesson 1.3: Variables 
* Learner will be able to create and use variables to output a result using various assignment operators and data types
* Introduction to varible types `int`  ` float`  `str`  `bool`and concatenating different data types. Operators such as, `=` `*=` `/=`


Chapter 2: Lists
-----------------------------------

Lesson 2.1: Creating lists and Storing Data
* Learner will be able to create and interpret a list
* Create and output lists of different data types 

Lesson 2.2: Accessing Data
* Learner will be able to illustrate accessing data in lists
* Introduction to indexing, negative indexing, range of indexing and checking if data exists `in` a list

Lesson 2.3: Manipulating Data & Joining lists
* Learner will be able to illustrate manipulating data in lists
* Change, add and remove list items: `append()` `insert()` `extend()` `remove()` `del()` `clear()`. Join lists using `+` and `extend()`

Lesson 2.4: Sorting Data 
* Learner will effectively sort data from lists using a range of sorting methods
* `sort()` lists alaphbetically, numerically, descending, case insensitive, reverse order

Chapter 3: Improving efficiency 
------------------------------------------------

Lesson 3.1: Creating Functions
* Learner will be able to create functions and receive arguments
* Create a function using `def`, pass variables, and `return` variables

Lesson 3.2: Calling Functions
* Learner will be able to use import existing functions to improve efficiency of code
* Call existing functions in a block of code

Lesson 3.3: Creating & Importing Modules
* Learner will be able to write and import existing modules to improve efficiency of code
* Introduction to writing modules `.py` and importing modules, introduction to built-in modules 

Lesson 3.4: Packages
* Learner will be able to organise modules into packages and sub packages
* What is a package and why we use them, how to create a package to store modules, how to control package initialization


Chapter 4: NumPy
----------------------------------------------

1. Learner will be able to decribe what NumPy is and why we use it
2. Learner will be able to create an array
3. Learner will be able to select elements from 2D and 3D arrays
4. Learner will be able to demonstrate searching, sorting and filtering arrays
