Course: Introduction to Python
================================

Chapter 1: Syntax
-------------------------------------------------------

Lesson 1.1: Introduction
* Learner will be able to use basic Python syntax to output a message and describe why we use Python
* Introduction to what Python is, Python interface, outputing a message `print` & commenting `#`. 

Lesson 1.2: Calulator
* Learner will be able to use Python to calculate simple math problems
* Using Python as a calulator: `+` `-` `*`  `/`  `%`  `**` 

Lesson 1.3: Variables 
* Learner will be able to create and use variables to output a result using various assignment operators and data types
* Introduction to varible types `int`  ` float`  `str`  `bool`and concatenating different data types. Operators such as, `=` `*=` `/=`


Chapter 2: Lists
-----------------------------------

Lesson 2.1: Creating lists and Storing Data
* Learner will be able to create and interpret a list
* Create and output lists of different data types 

Lesson 2.2: Accessing Data, Indexing and Slicing
* Learner will be able to illustrate accessing data in lists
* Introduction to indexing, negative indexing, range of indexing and checking if data exists `in` a list. `slice()` function to slice a sequence

Lesson 2.3: Sorting Data 
* Learner will effectively sort data from lists using a range of sorting methods
* `sort()` lists alaphbetically, numerically, descending, case insensitive, reverse order

Lesson 2.4: Manipulating Data
* Learner will be able to illustrate manipulating data in lists
* Change, add and remove list items: `append()` `insert()` `extend()` `remove()` `del()` `clear()`. Join lists using `+` and `extend()`


Chapter 3: Improving efficiency 
------------------------------------------------

Lesson 3.1: Creating Functions
* Learner will be able to create functions and receive arguments
* Create a function using `def`, pass variables, and `return` variables

Lesson 3.2: Calling Functions
* Learner will be able to use import existing functions to improve efficiency of code
* Call existing functions in a block of code

Lesson 3.3: Creating & Importing Modules
* Learner will be able to write and import existing modules to improve efficiency of code
* Introduction to writing modules `.py` and importing modules, introduction to built-in modules 

Lesson 3.4: Packages
* Learner will be able to organise modules into packages and sub packages and import existing packages
* What is a package and why we use them, how to create a package to store modules, how to control package initialization, existing packages


Chapter 4: NumPy
----------------------------------------------

Lesson 4.1: Introduction to NumPy
* Learner will be able to install and Import NumPy, decribe what NumPy is and why we use it
* What is NumPy used for, why, what does it stand for. Why we use NumPy in datascience - arrays are frequently used and speed is very important. NumPy is faster than lists. Where to find the codebase and how to install. 


Lesson 4.2: Arrays
* Learner will be able to create a NumPy array
* Create Python lists and import NumPy package, create NumPy arrays out of the lists created. 

Lesson 4.3: 2D Arrays
* Learner will be able to create, sort, search and modify elements from 2D arrays
* Introduction to 2D arrays in Python, `ndarray` class in NumPy. Create a basic array using `np.array()` apply `np.sort()` 

Lesson 4.4: Subsets
* Learner will be able to demonstrate searching, sorting and filtering arrays
*
